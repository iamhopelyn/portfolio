Some challenges that I faced while making this game was changing the amount of body parts of the snake because the amount of body parts you get equals your official score.</a></span>
      <span><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/186060334/" target="_blank">This project is call "Collect the Dots". In this game you have to collect all the green dots. They give you points while the red ones take points away. One difficult part of this project was creating the scoreboard because of how rapidly your score could change in this game.  </a></span>
