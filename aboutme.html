      <p>Hi everyone, i'm Hopelyn Parkinson. I am a 13 year old soon to be freshman at Laguardia, vocal major. I am also a level four classical ballerina. I am the middle child of both my sisters. The older one is  is 14 and the younger one is 5 . When I get older, I aspire to be a Law reform and criminal justice  lawyer because I need to provide a voice for the African American people that feel like they don't have one. This year is computer science we have learned about different types of coding like scratch, python, html, and CSS. Personally, my favorite project is the about me project that we worked on i tri 1. I spoke a lot about me and my hobbies and they had some really cute pictures. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</p>
